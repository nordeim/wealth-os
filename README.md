A self-hostable **premium personal-finance workspace** — income, expenses,
accounts, investments, budgets, goals, CSV import, analytics, and an
AI-powered financial coach in one polished dashboard. Functionally a
superset of the reference app, visually at parity with it.

## Overview

WealthOS answers one question: *where is my money actually going?* It
unifies scattered bank statements, subscription renewals, investment
holdings, and savings targets into a single dashboard with month-over-month
deltas, 50/30/20 budget shares, and cashflow trends — then adds an AI coach
that turns those numbers into concrete recommendations. It runs entirely on
your own infrastructure (SQLite by default, PostgreSQL optional) with
cookie-based auth, rate limiting, and a hardened production boot — no
third-party accounts required.

The demo corpus ships deterministic seed data (six months of realistic
transactions, three accounts, six holdings, five goals) so every chart is
alive from the first login.

## Key Features

## Quick Start

Requires **Bun ≥ 1.3** (or Node ≥ 20 with npm — swap `bun run` for `npm run`).

1. **Clone and install**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nordeim/wealth-os.git
   cd wealth-os
   bun install        # also regenerates the prisma client into src/generated/prisma
   ```

2. **Configure environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # .env ships ready for local dev:
   #   DATABASE_URL="file:../db/custom.db"   (db/ at the repo root)
   #   AUTH_SECRET=""                        (dev fallback; REQUIRED in production)
   ```

3. **Create the database + demo data**

   ```bash
   bun run db:push    # apply prisma/schema.prisma to db/custom.db
   bun run db:seed    # demo user + 6 months of deterministic finance data
   ```

4. **Start the dev server**

   ```bash
   bun run dev        # http://localhost:3000
   ```

**Verify setup:** log in with `sepnetflix2023@outlook.com` / `$Abcd1234`
(the seed's demo credentials) — the Financial Dashboard should render with
populated KPI cards and charts. Then `bun run db:census` should print
`census: MATCH`.

For production: `bun run build && bun run start` (standalone output on
`PORT`), with a real `AUTH_SECRET` (`openssl rand -hex 32`) — a missing or
short secret **fails the production boot by design**.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | `file:../db/custom.db` (SQLite, `db/` at repo root) or a PostgreSQL URL — resolved against `prisma/schema.prisma` in CLI, build, and runtime alike (`src/lib/db-path.ts`) |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | prod | HMAC key for the session cookie; ≥16 chars; the production boot refuses to serve without it |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | build | Canonical origin for metadata, OG/Twitter cards, robots, sitemap, manifest — inlined at build time |
| `NEO_PROXY_HOPS` | no | Trusted proxy depth for rate-limit IP keying (default 1; fails closed) |
| `NEO_DISABLE_IN_APP_OTP` | no | `"1"` stops returning the signup verification code in the response (for real mail transports) |
| `NEO_DISABLE_IN_APP_RESET` | no | `"1"` stops returning the reset link in the forgot-password response |

## Testing

| Suite | Command | Count |
|---|---|---|
| Unit (Vitest) | `bun run test` | 1519 checks / 91 files |
| E2E (Playwright, chromium) | `CI=1 bun run test:e2e` | 147 checks / 7 specs — boots its own server on :3100 with `db/e2e.db` |
| Smoke ladder (standalone artifact) | `bun run smoke` | 15 assertions incl. boot-gate + artifact hygiene |
| Full gate | `bun run gate` | lint → typecheck → test → build → smoke → e2e |
| Parity sweeps | `bun run gate:full` | **active** (re-activated v2.8.0 / R-4.5): the standing gate + six WealthOS-native drift gates — the four sweep classes (1440×900 · 390×844 · 768×1024 · 1024×768, theme-matched zero-data baselines), the fullpage sweep (the 11-page below-the-fold axis with the zero-data sentinel), and the interior census (four-axis standing allowances at margin 0) — green end-to-end from cold at v2.8.0; run it when parity surfaces changed or per the standing cadence (the pre-push bar stays `bun run gate`; the sweep legs need the live reference, so `gate` remains the offline gate) |

Special prerequisites: none — the e2e suite pins its own `DATABASE_URL`
(`db/e2e.db`) and reseeds in global setup; the smoke ladder boots the
built standalone artifact on :3210 with a scratch `db/smoke.db`.

## API Reference

All handlers return the envelope `{ ok: true, data } | { ok: false, error: { code, message } }`
and require the session cookie unless marked public.

| Endpoint | Methods | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/health` | GET | Public readiness probe (db round-trip) |
| `/api/auth/login` · `/logout` · `/me` | POST/GET | Session lifecycle; login rate-limited 10/IP/15min |
| `/api/auth/signup` · `/verify` · `/resend` | POST | Signup + OTP verification (in-app code by default) |
| `/api/auth/forgot-password` · `/reset-password` | POST | Reset funnel (rate-limited; no account enumeration) |
| `/api/transactions` · `/api/transactions/[id]` | GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE | Full CRUD; type + month filters |
| `/api/income-sources` · `/api/accounts` · `/api/investments` · `/api/goals` · `/api/budgets` | GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE | Resource CRUD (goals carry contribution round-trips) |
| `/api/dashboard` | GET | The dashboard's aggregate payload (KPIs, series, budgets, upcoming) |
| `/api/ai/coach` | POST | The coach: question → insights + answer |
| `/api/import` | POST | CSV commit (rows validated client-side through the 3-step wizard; GET returns the column-hint vocabulary) |
| `/api/export` · `/api/reset` · `/api/search` · `/api/settings` · `/api/users` | GET/POST | Data export, per-user demo reset, global search, per-user settings, own profile (session-scoped since session 214) |
| `/api/upload` · `/api/uploads/[name]` | POST/GET | Bounded file store (5 MB — the reference's own cap; path-traversal guarded) |

⚠️ `/api/reset` wipes the **calling user's** finance data — destructive
(session 214: every delete is owner-scoped; other accounts' rows survive).

## Design System

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-primary` | `#f59e0b` (amber-500) | Primary buttons (amber→yellow gradient), brand |
| `--color-primary-hover` | `#d97706` (amber-600) | Hover state |
| `--color-background` | `#faf9f7` | Light page wash |
| `--color-foreground` / `--color-ink` | `#1c1917` (stone-900) | Headings, body |
| `--color-muted` | `#78716c` (stone-500) | Secondary text, inactive tabs |
| `--color-line` | `#e7e5e4` (stone-200) | Card borders, dividers |
| Emerald | `#059669` family | Positive deltas, income, success |
| Red | `#dc2626` family | Negative deltas, destructive |

Typography: Inter-first system stack (no runtime font fetch). Motion:
`tw-animate-css` for Radix open/close transitions; dark theme via a
`.dark` class toggle that re-maps the same token set.

## Project Status

| Phase | Status | Key Deliverables |
|---|---|---|
| WealthOS transformation (session 199) | ✅ Complete | Finance schema + seed, 20 API families, 9 sections + aliases, shell + drawer, theme, AI coach |
| Verification layer | ✅ Complete | 1519 unit · 147 e2e · 15 smoke · full gate green |
| Documentation set | ✅ Complete | README, AGENTS, CLAUDE, PAD, `wealth-os_SKILL.md` (the distilled engineering skill), worklog |
| Remediation program | 🔀 Active | `docs/remediation_plan_v2.md` — the versioned findings ledger + R-item program (session 241: **R-38 shipped — the clear-era, creation-path, and seam-completion round**: the fresh-eyes audit (three Mode-C passes over the R-37 cure surfaces, the API/auth/security layer, and the UI/a11y/shell layer — 0 Critical / 0 High / 2 Medium / 7 Low / 4 Informational raw after dedup, every material claim re-verified at file:line; all six R-37 cure surfaces verified holding); the cold baseline GREEN at HEAD 71a4d9f (the v2.37.0 ship state reproduced exactly); the reference STABLE on every drift layer incl. the TRUE-390 mobile menu with 9 destinations); the **clear-era cure** (F-241a Medium — the R-37 live-user re-key had removed the session-era dimension: a previous user's late 401 walled a live new user's face, a 401 inside logout's POST window aborted the clear, a first-load concurrent-hydrate twin slipped a revoked 200 past the wall, and a dead session's 401 on the error face skipped the wall — four interleavings, one cure: a module-level clear-era counter advanced only by the wall's commit and logout's entry, captured at every fetch's entry and compared before walling); the **signup creation-path ceiling** (F-241b — the R-37 global bucket counted every attempt that reached the handler (ten per-IP-denied requests blocked all signups app-wide) and its colon-carried key was client-mintable from the per-IP keyspace; the ceiling now rides the creation path under the hyphenated key — only fresh-email creation attempts count); plus the limiter's cardinality cap (F-241c — a fail-closed shared overflow bucket at the 10k cap), the P2025 arms on the auth writers (F-241d — verify/resend answer the no-enumeration miss forms, logout completes), the popover focus return (F-241e — the drawer's own cleanup pattern), and the FORM-INPUT-family seam completion (F-241f — FORM_TEXTAREA re-enters WITH its two consumers; the settings inline input joins as the width appendage; the icon-bearing search input registered as the deliberate single-site genus). Registered, not cured: the CSP default-src headroom (F-241g — needs a source inventory) and the seeded demo credentials posture (F-241h — the documented demo posture). Gate: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · **1519 unit / 91 files** · build · smoke 15/15 · 147 e2e · all six parity drift gates CLEAN (the standing allowances unmoved) · census MATCH · captures 166-169) |
